# QDC Secure Source Connection
This file replace the original file createQlikApp.js in the QDC standard installation along side the new file SourceConnection.js.
This intent is to create on fly connetion to the source with the profiled user credential such that from Qlik Sense each user can access ONLY to the allowed data.
